# Predicting Diabetes with Logistic Regression

## Overview

Pred_Diabetes is a project that aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset used in this project is the "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" dataset, which contains information about 768 patients. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, specifically logistic regression, the project aims to provide accurate predictions and insights for early diagnosis and prevention of diabetes.

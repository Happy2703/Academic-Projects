# Academic Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my academic project portfolio! This README provides an overview of the various projects I have completed during my academic journey. Each project is briefly described, highlighting its objectives, key outcomes, and the skills and tools used.

## Project 1: Predicting Diabetes Using Logistic Regression

**Description:** Predicting Diabetes is a project that aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset used in this project is the "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" dataset, which contains information about 768 patients. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, specifically logistic regression, the project aims to provide accurate predictions and insights for the early diagnosis and prevention of diabetes.

**Skills/Tools Used:**
**Tools**: Python 3.7 or above, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn.
**Skills**: Data preprocessing, Feature selection, Model training, Model evaluation, and Data visualization.

**Key Outcomes:** Utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases by using the API-stats models to develop a logistic regression model for predicting diabetes. Using diagnostic measurements from 768 women, the model achieved an accuracy of 80.2%, highlighting the significance of glucose levels, BMI, and insulin in determining the likelihood of diabetes. The study underscores the potential of data science in enhancing early diabetes detection and emphasizes the importance of feature selection in model performance.

## Project 2: Airbnb Price Prediction using Spark

**Description:** This project aims to predict Airbnb prices using Spark. Airbnb offers a unique platform for individuals to either provide or seek short-term lodging in private residences. Recently, Rio de Janeiro has become a popular destination for Airbnb listings. Accurately predicting the appropriate price for these listings is essential for hosts to optimize their earnings and for Airbnb to ensure competitive pricing, thereby driving more bookings. This project leverages machine learning regression models to predict Airbnb room prices in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, utilizing a dataset spanning from August 2018 to May 2020. To handle the large dataset and evaluate its scalability and computing capabilities, we leveraged the AWS infrastructure.

**Skills/Tools Used:** Apache Spark, Databricks, Jupyter Notebook, AWS Services: Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce), Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Python Libraries: PySpark, 
 Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas

**Key Outcomes:** Utilizing machine learning regression models on a refined dataset of 400K rows from Airbnb listings in Rio de Janeiro, the Gradient Boosting Trees Regression Model emerged as the most accurate predictor with an RMSE of 0.58, while the Decision Tree Regression model was the fastest; the study also underscored the efficiency of Amazon EMR in processing large datasets and highlighted the consistent and reliable performance of the data across various nodes, offering invaluable insights for optimizing Airbnb pricing strategies in Rio.

## Project 3: Advanced Customer Analytics: Retention Strategy with RFM Segmentation

**Description:** Enhancing customer engagement and retention in the competitive retail industry is crucial for businesses to drive revenue growth and bolster customer loyalty. By leveraging advanced customer analytics, including segmentation, churn prediction, and predictive marketing models, retail companies can pinpoint high-risk customers, comprehend their specific needs and preferences, and devise targeted retention strategies to mitigate churn. Through predictive modeling, businesses can accurately anticipate customer responses to future marketing campaigns, thereby enhancing overall customer engagement and loyalty.

**Skills/Tools Used:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, Unbalanced-learn, XGBoost, RFM strategy, K-means clustering algorithm

**Key Outcomes:** Through advanced customer analytics, the team employed K-means clustering and RFM analysis to segment customers, achieving a 60% churn prediction rate for high-risk segments, and utilized machine learning models like logistic regression, SMOTE, XGBoost, and Random Forest to predict marketing campaign responses, with logistic regression showing the highest accuracy and random forest exhibiting the highest precision for positive responses, ultimately providing businesses with insights to enhance customer engagement, optimize marketing strategies, and boost profitability.

## Project 4: Huawei's Marketing  Strategy: Social Network Analysis Using R

**Description:** This project analyzes Huawei's customer interactions on its social media platform to gain insights that can guide its marketing strategies. We used social network analysis tools and techniques to achieve our objectives.

**Skills/Tools Used:** Kaggle (Data source), R Studio, R Programming Language, Gephi (Visualization tool), Natural Language Processing (for data preprocessing)

**Key Outcomes:** Through a comprehensive social network analysis of Huawei's marketing strategy on Instagram, the study identified influential individuals like Alexis and Alveena, who have significant reach and standing within their social circles. By targeting such individuals with ads, Huawei can optimize its marketing efforts, leading to cost-effective campaigns and enhanced organic growth. The analysis also emphasized the potential of curated content creation based on influencer demography and recommended further refinement of data for more accurate results.

## Project 5: Customer Churn Prediction Using Discriminant Analysis

**Description:** Banks need to predict customer churn to maintain healthy business and customer relationships. This model focuses on predicting whether a customer will leave or stay with a bank based on their data. Key motivations include reducing negative brand feedback, retaining existing loyal customers, and saving on the higher cost of acquiring new ones.

**Skills/Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel, Excel Solver, Statistical Analysis, Optimization, and Data Visualization

**Key Outcomes:** The model provides a near-accurate prediction of customer churn, proving its potential utility for the banking sector. However, like all models, it has limitations. While it classifies about 80% of the data correctly, discrepancies remain. The model heavily relies on a customer's balance, indicating room for improvement in its predictive power across other attributes. Future iterations might consider integrating more sophisticated algorithms or integrating more data sources for improved accuracy.
